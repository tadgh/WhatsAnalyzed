26/03/2014, 1:05 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Make sure to stare into some non dong hanging person while doing it
26/03/2014, 1:06 p.m. - Steven Edgson: It asserts dominance
26/03/2014, 1:08 p.m. - Michael Conrad: And make helicopter noises with your mouth. Totally alpha

26/03/2014, 1:46 p.m. - James Edgson: <Media omitted>
26/03/2014, 1:46 p.m. - James Edgson: Check out my private detective office

26/03/2014, 1:47 p.m. - Steven Edgson: You will never be a pi you could never cut it
26/03/2014, 5:08 p.m. - James Edgson: I made a reservation for Duluth. How does $92 a person sound, they stiffed me with a bullshit extra person fee in trying to fight
26/03/2014, 5:11 p.m. - Steven Edgson: How much was the extra person fee
26/03/2014, 5:12 p.m. - James Edgson: Came out to an extra $80 usd
26/03/2014, 5:22 p.m. - Steven Edgson: A night?
26/03/2014, 5:24 p.m. - James Edgson: Total.
27/03/2014, 10:52 a.m. - Michael Conrad: Got the line of credit! Room for one more?
27/03/2014, 10:57 a.m. - James Edgson: I'll allow it
27/03/2014, 11:10 a.m. - Gary Graham: Woooooooo free money!
27/03/2014, 11:11 a.m. - Steven Edgson: Mike in a year "what do you mean I have to pay it back?"
27/03/2014, 11:21 a.m. - Michael Conrad: Just spent it all. Oh god I'm ruined
27/03/2014, 11:22 a.m. - Ryan Novak: Yay Mike is coming!
27/03/2014, 11:23 a.m. - Michael Conrad: Awwww yeah. Tell me were still doing brewfest
27/03/2014, 11:31 a.m. - Ryan Novak: Yeah that's the plan. I dunno, should we buy our tickets ahead of time just in case?
27/03/2014, 11:33 a.m. - James Edgson: I suppose it can't hurt
27/03/2014, 11:35 a.m. - James Edgson: Quickly checked it, the Brew fest location is only 15 minutes away from the hotel
27/03/2014, 11:43 a.m. - Ryan Novak: Well isn't that lucky. I assume that's driving?
27/03/2014, 11:44 a.m. - James Edgson: Yeah
27/03/2014, 11:54 a.m. - Steven Edgson: Should we get another room then?
27/03/2014, 11:55 a.m. - Ryan Novak: Well we have room for 8 right? How many do we have
27/03/2014, 11:55 a.m. - Steven Edgson: Really I thought there was only one room
27/03/2014, 11:58 a.m. - Ryan Novak: I'm pretty sure we settled on two Steve. Catch up
27/03/2014, 11:58 a.m. - James Edgson: Yeah I booked two rooms
27/03/2014, 11:58 a.m. - James Edgson: Works out to $92 a person because of some unexpected fees
27/03/2014, 12:00 p.m. - James Edgson: Myself, Kristin, Ryan, Steve, Conrad, Spencer, Kirsten. And I invited Katie as well
27/03/2014, 12:50 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: So we're not going to try and fight the retarded fee then. It just hurts thinking about spending that much on sleeping 2 nights in Duluth
27/03/2014, 12:53 p.m. - Gary Graham: How much would it be even without the fees? It can't be that different can it? James?
27/03/2014, 12:57 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Well all I know is we were planning on spending 125$ (+ tax) and now we'll be spending like 200$. It's not the end of the world but that seems like a lot for Duluth. And the reason for the charge just makes no sense to me. You're not allowed to have 4 people in a room with two queen beds? I'm not being cheap I just don't like throwing away money
27/03/2014, 12:58 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Considering we could have got a room on hotwire for around 60 a night. But that's the end of my rant.
27/03/2014, 12:58 p.m. - Gary Graham: Wait you got charged bonus person fee for having FOUR people?!
27/03/2014, 12:58 p.m. - Gary Graham: Weird
27/03/2014, 12:58 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Yea the fine print said after the 3rd person you get charged like 80 or something
27/03/2014, 12:59 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: That's what James told me I believe
27/03/2014, 12:59 p.m. - Gary Graham: Damn that's a lot for an extra person.
27/03/2014, 1:00 p.m. - James Edgson: Yeah, it's dumb I should have caught it before I booked, there's an extra fee per person in the room after 3 people
27/03/2014, 1:01 p.m. - James Edgson: An extra fee for the 4th person, in both rooms, per night.It was $80 total,
27/03/2014, 1:01 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Considering we're barely going to be there. I may skip the beer thing for some life reflection Kirsten time, it's the only way I can feel better, saving $30 at least :p
27/03/2014, 1:03 p.m. - James Edgson: There's lots of good sight seeing to do downtown. They have a fabulous marina and what not
27/03/2014, 1:04 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: And a pool

09/12/2014, 8:47 p.m. - James Edgson: There is only one Garbo
09/12/2014, 8:47 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: But you fit the description so nicely
09/12/2014, 8:48 p.m. - Steven Edgson: You weren't there, you don't know
09/12/2014, 8:50 p.m. - James Edgson: All I hear is "garbage garbage garbage"
09/12/2014, 8:51 p.m. - Steven Edgson: All I hear from you is that you don't love your mother and never visit, it's the least you could do James

09/12/2014, 9:13 p.m. - Gary Graham: There's already 12 entries for garbo :(

09/12/2014, 9:49 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Hahaha

09/12/2014, 10:57 p.m. - Gary Graham: Hahaha
09/12/2014, 10:58 p.m. - Steven Edgson: You called her Garbo! I feel like I'm taking crazy pills
09/12/2014, 10:59 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Why would I call her Garbo? That's your name.
09/12/2014, 11:13 p.m. - James Edgson: You heard it Garbo, you're the only Garbo

11/12/2014, 3:31 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Secret Santa gathering tonight folks?

11/12/2014, 4:09 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Are we still talking alcohol or any kind of gift
11/12/2014, 4:10 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I think as long as we set a price limit you can sorta do whatever works best for the person
11/12/2014, 4:10 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Alcohol included:P
11/12/2014, 4:10 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Aiight
11/12/2014, 4:16 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Kk cool like the quick thinking Mike
11/12/2014, 4:41 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Another way to do it is to just pick numbers and buy a universal/ unisex gift not for a specific person. The number u get is the order u pick the gift under the tree
11/12/2014, 4:44 p.m. - Mike Gleeson: So alcohol?

12/01/2015, 2:38 p.m. - Allison Norris: I'm interested
12/01/2015, 2:39 p.m. - Brie Gibson: We just want to do a possible group trip this time since we already did one just us two
12/01/2015, 2:40 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I'm going to start looking online at prices and I may go to a travel agent also,
12/01/2015, 2:40 p.m. - James Edgson: And it sucked so obviously you want to pick it up a notch this time
12/01/2015, 2:40 p.m. - Brie Gibson: If no one can we're still going lol
12/01/2015, 2:40 p.m. - Brie Gibson: And no it was awesome lol
12/01/2015, 2:41 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Not a chance I can get off work in march
12/01/2015, 2:41 p.m. - James Edgson: Great
12/01/2015, 2:42 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Oh shit taxes..well depending who's down we can move it up end of Feb perhaps
12/01/2015, 2:42 p.m. - Steven Edgson: It doesn't matter, now until June is out for me
12/01/2015, 2:43 p.m. - Brie Gibson: We'll take a fun trip in the summer then too! Lol
12/01/2015, 3:06 p.m. - James Edgson: Just forget about Steve
12/01/2015, 3:07 p.m. - Alyson: Me and Myles are down
12/01/2015, 3:07 p.m. - Alyson: We just have both been to Cuba so preferably not there
12/01/2015, 3:08 p.m. - James Edgson: Meeexicooo
12/01/2015, 3:08 p.m. - Alyson: Just have to make sure it's not during march break or it's double the price to go anywhere
12/01/2015, 3:08 p.m. - James Edgson: Oh yeah good idea
12/01/2015, 3:09 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I was shooting for punta or Jamaica
12/01/2015, 3:09 p.m. - Brie Gibson: No match break!
12/01/2015, 3:09 p.m. - Brie Gibson: March*
12/01/2015, 3:10 p.m. - Alyson: Punta is mediocre ... Super isolated resorts like you can't go anywhere
12/01/2015, 3:10 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Well we were just gunna stay on resort this time and relax/party we did soo many excursions last time too busy
12/01/2015, 3:10 p.m. - Alyson: Negril beach is Jamaica is probably the best bet ! There is tons to do
12/01/2015, 3:10 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Jamaica may be pricey but I'll look
12/01/2015, 3:11 p.m. - Alyson: You can walk along the beach there's tons of shops and beach bars and it's like 7km of straight beach
12/01/2015, 3:11 p.m. - James Edgson: Well no matter where the resort is if you want to stay within it that's fine
12/01/2015, 3:12 p.m. - James Edgson: Kelsey and I were talking about how fun it is to go into town for bars and things. It's nice to have that option and not be isolated
12/01/2015, 3:13 p.m. - Alyson: Yeah for sure I just found punta cana to be a bit overrated ... Like it's JUST resorts and no shops no nothing and super far to go anywhere and it isn't really a party place
12/01/2015, 3:13 p.m. - Allison Norris: As long as it's not super pricey, I'm down for anywhere warm. I've never been anywhere tropical
12/01/2015, 3:13 p.m. - Alyson: My vote is negril beach Jamaica !
12/01/2015, 3:14 p.m. - James Edgson: Whatever that is it sounds cool
12/01/2015, 3:28 p.m. - Allison Norris: What's the cheapest way of booking a trip? Travel agent?
12/01/2015, 3:31 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: I think flight network was pretty decent when we were looking for our Cuba trip
12/01/2015, 3:33 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: I'm on hotwire, shows a nice one on the beach in negril for $808 from march 7-14
12/01/2015, 3:33 p.m. - James Edgson: Everyone just let Alyson do it
12/01/2015, 3:42 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Well Jamaica is my hope👌 but I'll see how the prices run ! I would be willing to do mexico again ..but not Mayan Riviera
12/01/2015, 3:43 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Well I just want to make sure the price is within our reach because I would like to go
12/01/2015, 3:44 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Yes of course I'm shooting for lower prices so of Jamaica is all over $1400 I prob won't do it.
12/01/2015, 3:44 p.m. - Brie Gibson: But I'm not gunna stay in a 2 star hotel either lol I've heard bad things
12/01/2015, 3:44 p.m. - Alyson: Travel agents do nothing
12/01/2015, 3:45 p.m. - Alyson: We tried to use one for punta and it was pointless
12/01/2015, 3:45 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: There's no way we can go that high lol... If you guys find one you love and are willing to pay around that then we'll have to just stay behind I guess
12/01/2015, 3:45 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Except get mad commission, I've done year end work for them and holy shit they make money
12/01/2015, 3:45 p.m. - Alyson: Usually redtag or selloffvacations are the best way
12/01/2015, 3:45 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I just go there so I can see my options I hate having to plan my own connecting flights
12/01/2015, 3:46 p.m. - Brie Gibson: It was a pain last time when I tried on my own
12/01/2015, 3:46 p.m. - Alyson: You don't ! Lol you just type in where you wanna go on redtag and they do your connecting flights !!
12/01/2015, 3:46 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I'll check it again this time tho!
12/01/2015, 3:47 p.m. - Alyson: Redtag does it all and selloff ...and I can usually find cheaper deals than them anyway lol I should open a travel agent business
12/01/2015, 3:48 p.m. - Brie Gibson: U look and shoot us some ideas! Negril would be aeesomeeee or ocho
12/01/2015, 3:49 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I'll look too 👌
12/01/2015, 3:51 p.m. - Brie Gibson: $1200 with all the taxes and shit would be ideal😏
12/01/2015, 3:57 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Cancun seems to be well priced, wouldn't they have nightlife too?
12/01/2015, 3:58 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Its cray cray in Cancun huge city
12/01/2015, 3:58 p.m. - Brie Gibson: It kinda scares me lol
12/01/2015, 3:58 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I'm sure no matter where we go, the more of us that can come the better it'll be
12/01/2015, 3:58 p.m. - Alyson: Cancun is amazing
12/01/2015, 3:59 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: I think it would be fun, this one I'm looking at is right on the beach
12/01/2015, 4:02 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Let's still look into Jamaica or something , ive been to mexico twice
12/01/2015, 4:08 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I'd prefer a more chilled out base of operations than somewhere super busy
12/01/2015, 4:08 p.m. - Michael Conrad: With good options for going out when we wanna
12/01/2015, 4:08 p.m. - Myles Vescio: Acapulco Mexico lol
12/01/2015, 4:08 p.m. - Alyson: I'll look for some deals to both...
12/01/2015, 4:08 p.m. - Alyson: YAAAAA

12/01/2015, 4:10 p.m. - Myles Vescio: I just wanna go somewhere I can say "No Grassia"
12/01/2015, 4:11 p.m. - Alyson: I'll look for a deal I just need to shower cause some native lady is coming to pick up laundry detergent lol
12/01/2015, 4:11 p.m. - Myles Vescio: Who the fuck is picking up what and why?
12/01/2015, 4:11 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I trust in any the trip guru
12/01/2015, 4:11 p.m. - Steven Edgson: That seemed really odd
12/01/2015, 4:12 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Uhhh what
12/01/2015, 4:13 p.m. - Alyson: HAHA like 5 months ago I accidently bought non he washer detergent and you can't use it on he machines or they'll get all messed up and I don't have the receipt and no one has those top loader machines so I'm giving it away on buy and sell and this lady says she has no money and needs some so she's coming to get it

13/01/2015, 8:20 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Lol no I just said I'll look where me and mike want to go.  Dominican probably and let u guys know and if anyone wants to join they can
13/01/2015, 8:50 p.m. - Allison Norris: I'm confused lol
13/01/2015, 8:51 p.m. - Alyson: Melissa wants to be added
13/01/2015, 8:53 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Me and mike want to go sooner. If everyone else is set on a cuba trip in April I will not be attending that. But I will post where we plan to go  and if anyone wants to join us they can. That is all👌
13/01/2015, 8:54 p.m. - Allison Norris: How soon?
13/01/2015, 8:55 p.m. - Brie Gibson: End of Feb beginning of march if I find something good. If I don't I'm still willing to wait til end of march. we haven't had time to look yet so I'm just going blind right now
13/01/2015, 8:57 p.m. - Allison Norris: What about mid- end March? That way it's a bit later but not too far away and everyone can come?
13/01/2015, 8:58 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Well not march break cuz its expensive and end march is usually expensive too but I'm gunna look for diff times
13/01/2015, 9:07 p.m. - Allison Norris: Okay, just let me know what you're fine with and I'll go from there
13/01/2015, 10:09 p.m. - Kelsey Novak: Change of subject .. Let's go to on deck Friday!!!!
14/01/2015, 3:56 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Started looking at Cozumel mexico, looks awesome. Me and mike r doing more research tonight
14/01/2015, 3:56 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Just commented on Facebook but I thought you didn't want to go back to Mexico..
14/01/2015, 4:10 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I answered on there I'll keep the posting on there
14/01/2015, 4:11 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: Yea saw it, this trip stuff is getting a little confusing is all
14/01/2015, 4:13 p.m. - Alyson: I can't go in feb and maybe not even In march ... So we might end up doing 2 trips if you guys don't wanna go in April
14/01/2015, 4:14 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: April is better for us as well
14/01/2015, 4:14 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Awesome. I can go whenever so if there are 2 trips, I can cherry pick the best group.
14/01/2015, 4:16 p.m. - Allison Norris: I can also go whenever
14/01/2015, 4:16 p.m. - Alyson: I'll talk to Myles when he gets home
14/01/2015, 4:17 p.m. - Alyson: I don't really mind where we go as long as it's under 1200 and doesn't have bed bugs .. Oh and on the beach lol
14/01/2015, 4:17 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Brie just post your trip once your booked because you have the most specific needs. Whoever wants and can join you will and then whoever is left can plan a much better trip for later on
14/01/2015, 4:20 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Would u guys be shooting for first week of April like march 30th to April 7th?
14/01/2015, 4:40 p.m. - Allison Norris: Is Cuba completely out of the question?
14/01/2015, 4:41 p.m. - Alyson: Yeah that week would be ok
14/01/2015, 4:41 p.m. - Alyson: No I don't think so I think it's an option
14/01/2015, 4:42 p.m. - Allison Norris: <Media omitted>
14/01/2015, 4:42 p.m. - Allison Norris: I'm just searching all inclusive and March 31st it's apparently under 800 for all inclusive 7 days
14/01/2015, 4:42 p.m. - Alyson: I think that one involves a night in Toronto ... Maybe not but look at flight details
14/01/2015, 4:46 p.m. - Allison Norris: Aww no, I'm horrible at this. That would be if we were departing from Toronto. It's an extra 300 to depart from Tbay
14/01/2015, 4:47 p.m. - Gary Graham: Yooooo Toronto hype
14/01/2015, 4:48 p.m. - Alyson: I find selloffvacations and redtag are the best
14/01/2015, 4:48 p.m. - Alyson: I've done lots of trips with then
14/01/2015, 4:49 p.m. - Brie Gibson: We'll I'm not opposed to very beginning of April if u guts r choosing a decent resort
14/01/2015, 4:50 p.m. - Allison Norris: It's 845 to depart March 31st from Tbay to Varadero
14/01/2015, 4:51 p.m. - Allison Norris: 3.5 stars
14/01/2015, 4:51 p.m. - Alyson: Yeah there was a few decent resorts on the 31 and I think if it's with sunwing it's a straight flight to Cuba
14/01/2015, 4:51 p.m. - Allison Norris: It's through westjet vacations
14/01/2015, 4:51 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Shit and easter falls on 4th 5th.....that screws up alit some places will have no staff or don't serve boize etc..
14/01/2015, 4:51 p.m. - Alyson: You think so?
14/01/2015, 4:51 p.m. - Allison Norris: <Media omitted>
14/01/2015, 4:51 p.m. - Allison Norris: Lol it's easier to explain through the use of pictures
14/01/2015, 4:52 p.m. - Alyson: I don't think they can do that ... If you pay for all inclusive they have to have staff .. They do on Christmas
14/01/2015, 4:52 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Gotta research it, cuz before i booked mine last year I read a lot of stuff about that
14/01/2015, 4:53 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Lol can we designate 2 people at most to figure it out. We're never going to get anywhere if we keep making 100 options to choose from
14/01/2015, 4:53 p.m. - Alyson: Yeah westjet has a stop but I think sunwing has a flight straight to Cuba from Tbay leaving on the 30th of march
14/01/2015, 4:54 p.m. - Allison Norris: I designate aly then, you know your stuff
14/01/2015, 4:54 p.m. - Alyson: Ok so the only absolute deal breakers for everyone is no Mexico except Cozumel and preferably close to April and around 800 right ? And maybe no nights in Toronto cause that can add up
14/01/2015, 4:54 p.m. - Alyson: Bree how do you feel about Cuba ?
14/01/2015, 4:54 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Brie Alyson and Allison. You guys are planning committee. Create a new committee group and tell us the plan once its firm
14/01/2015, 4:55 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Noo I font care mexico us fine just not Mayan riviera / plata Del Carmen
14/01/2015, 4:56 p.m. - Ryan Novak: End of March, beginning of April. Try not to break the bank. Now off with you.
14/01/2015, 4:56 p.m. - Alyson: Ok ok I made a new group were gone
14/01/2015, 4:56 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Mike is pretty against Cuba but we'll see
14/01/2015, 4:56 p.m. - Gary Graham: Peace and quiet at last
14/01/2015, 4:57 p.m. - Ryan Novak: (((👋
14/01/2015, 5:06 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Finally
14/01/2015, 5:09 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Picky People Picking Planes to Paradise. Hard to say and harder to watch
14/01/2015, 5:09 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Lol good group name I'm changing our other group
14/01/2015, 5:33 p.m. - Kelsey Novak: Love how everyone ignored my on deck comment jeez
14/01/2015, 5:33 p.m. - Steven Edgson: We're busy
14/01/2015, 5:36 p.m. - Kelsey Novak: .....
14/01/2015, 5:40 p.m. - Kelsey Novak: Wow you guys are actually dicks
14/01/2015, 5:43 p.m. - Rachel Harris: Sorry Kelsey I might be able to! :)
14/01/2015, 5:44 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Maybes I'm unsure at the moment
14/01/2015, 5:44 p.m. - Alyson: I work sat morning 😑
14/01/2015, 5:59 p.m. - Alyson: ok we have narrowed it down a bit Bree posted it in the group
14/01/2015, 6:00 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I'm posting on the fb
14/01/2015, 6:00 p.m. - Brie Gibson: The links
14/01/2015, 6:00 p.m. - Gary Graham: Yo invite me to the fb group
14/01/2015, 6:00 p.m. - Brie Gibson: 2 choices . okay Gary!
14/01/2015, 6:09 p.m. - James Edgson: Wow who forgot Gary
14/01/2015, 6:10 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I can't add him to it, so Ryan add
14/01/2015, 6:10 p.m. - Ryan Novak: I added him
... Didn't I?
14/01/2015, 6:11 p.m. - James Edgson: I think that's awfully telling Ryan.
14/01/2015, 6:11 p.m. - James Edgson: How can you even call yourself a friend
14/01/2015, 6:29 p.m. - Gary Graham: Also, trips out of Toronto are like 300 less so if I have the time I'll come
14/01/2015, 6:53 p.m. - Ryan Novak: You guys are posting a bunch of maybes on Facebook. Don't resurface from the planning committee chat until you have definites. Too many options
14/01/2015, 6:53 p.m. - Brie Gibson: K sorry Jamaica ended up being stupid flight
14/01/2015, 6:54 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Cozumel is for sure we r finding a Cuba one to have 2 choices
14/01/2015, 6:55 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Limit it to 2 final choices where we can have a civilized vote. No outside options from those two. You 3 decide
14/01/2015, 6:56 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I know I'm trying!!
14/01/2015, 6:57 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Take your time. You guys just keep posting options and its ridiculous to choose from everything with this many people
14/01/2015, 6:58 p.m. - Alyson: Ok we have our two options I think
14/01/2015, 6:59 p.m. - Gary Graham: List them
14/01/2015, 7:00 p.m. - Ryan Novak: No don't. List them when that "I think" has been resolved
14/01/2015, 7:02 p.m. - James Edgson: Sounds like we have too many cooks in the kitchen!
14/01/2015, 7:03 p.m. - Alyson: Hahaha no it's just hard to please everyone so we just picked 2 in the middle so everyone has to compromise
14/01/2015, 7:03 p.m. - Alyson: So now we can vote
14/01/2015, 7:03 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Those r the final ones no note outside votes
14/01/2015, 7:07 p.m. - Allison Norris: Where do we vote?
14/01/2015, 7:07 p.m. - Alyson: Hmm maybe comments
14/01/2015, 7:07 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Just on there I suppose I'll put up a new post vte under it
14/01/2015, 7:07 p.m. - Ryan Novak: How are the final options both over a grand?
14/01/2015, 7:08 p.m. - Alyson: Well anything less was 2 star or had bad reviews
14/01/2015, 7:08 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Ya we tried for  900 or under it was stupid
14/01/2015, 7:09 p.m. - Brie Gibson: When I brought this up I said from the beginning not over $1300, its hard to find anything good quality for under $1000 sorry
14/01/2015, 7:09 p.m. - Ryan Novak: There is no way. Several cheaper options were posted yesterday
14/01/2015, 7:09 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Those r the choices
14/01/2015, 7:09 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Last time we did an all inclusive it was cheap as hell and it was the best time ever
14/01/2015, 7:11 p.m. - Alyson: All those ones had bad reviews though or involved a night in Toronto
14/01/2015, 7:12 p.m. - Alyson: Ugh this is hard ... I don't care that much to be honest but it's really hard to please everyone so we tried to go in the middle
14/01/2015, 7:13 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Yes we tried so if it doesn't suit everyone, I'm sorry if this trip doesn't happen I may go earlier then .
14/01/2015, 7:16 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Do you want to go just you and mike or as a group? I feel you need to know that before we can be productive
14/01/2015, 7:18 p.m. - Alyson: This is turning into a mess ... There isn't much for under 1000 but we can do it .. Bree and mike want a little bit nicer so if we all want to go together we have to compromise or go separately
14/01/2015, 7:19 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I want a griuo
14/01/2015, 7:19 p.m. - Brie Gibson: But this was suppose to be easier.  I should have picked a place with mike said who wants to come?   I just won't settle for bad quality when I'm willing to pay the few hundred more. So if u guys chose one we don't like, its okay we can go somewhere else on our own
14/01/2015, 7:19 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Exactly
14/01/2015, 7:21 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Friends + 3 star > Solo + 4 star. Just my opinion
14/01/2015, 7:22 p.m. - Allison Norris: Honestly, the $900 one doesn't look too bad!
14/01/2015, 7:22 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Well u just told us to pick 2 we did and now it's not good enough so I duno
14/01/2015, 7:23 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I don't think anyone should have to be chastised for wanting what they want or what works for them. We started this conversation with a rough price range and dates just to see who might want to join us and now I feel like people are pissed off about our preferences despite specifically stating them at the start of the conversation
14/01/2015, 7:24 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: I don't think anyone was being chastised for anything..?
14/01/2015, 7:24 p.m. - Alyson: I don't think anyone's mad just frustrated .. Everyone has different wants lol
14/01/2015, 7:25 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lol well maybe that's it then. Either way we obviously want to go with as many people as possible but its hard to get what's everyone wants
14/01/2015, 7:25 p.m. - Alyson: I don't know maybe we can just do the 900 one to Cuba so that it's more affordable .. And it's a straight flight which is unreal
14/01/2015, 7:25 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Especially in the span of one day of looking lol
14/01/2015, 7:25 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: I think Ryan was just saying that we all had a great experience at our Cuba 3 star even though some reviews may have been bad, some good
14/01/2015, 7:26 p.m. - Rachel Harris: I don't mind paying more for a better time personally; the problem is not everyone wants to
14/01/2015, 7:26 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Well that's a good point to consider for sure, and I think Rachel hit the nail on the head
14/01/2015, 7:27 p.m. - Rachel Harris: So everyone post in the damn Facebook group and stop blowing up my phone hahha
14/01/2015, 7:28 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lmao agreed!
14/01/2015, 7:28 p.m. - Alyson: Yeah I agree BUT if it's the difference if someone can come or not then Id rather go down a star
14/01/2015, 7:28 p.m. - Ryan Novak: What's more fun? Including more people or a slightly nicer resort?
14/01/2015, 7:28 p.m. - Kelsey Novak: Some people just can't afford it .. Not that they don't want to pay the money
14/01/2015, 7:28 p.m. - Alyson: Exactly .. Id go somewhere maybe less fancy so everyone can come
14/01/2015, 7:29 p.m. - Allison Norris: My thoughts exactly, regardless we are all going to be together in a tropical location. As long as the rooms are decent and good food..
14/01/2015, 7:29 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Its not that were looking for anything fancy, we just had the idea that we ran into some money and thought wed go somewhere nice since we can never usually afford it
14/01/2015, 7:29 p.m. - Alyson: Yeah I get that ... I'm just thinking that maybe we need to split up so everyone can come
14/01/2015, 7:30 p.m. - Alyson: And everyone is happy / within budget
14/01/2015, 7:30 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Well that's a possibility but let's keep looking for now, no harm in seeing what's possible
14/01/2015, 7:31 p.m. - Myles Vescio: Mhhmmmmm
14/01/2015, 7:32 p.m. - Alyson: Lol Myles
14/01/2015, 7:33 p.m. - Kelsey Novak: Just get me to the ocean and I'm good
14/01/2015, 7:35 p.m. - Brie Gibson: 🙉🙈
14/01/2015, 7:36 p.m. - Nick Berardi: :(   still can't go will still be in school I'm April
14/01/2015, 7:52 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Nick I'm with you, unless I get a new job I'm not go
14/01/2015, 7:52 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Going
14/01/2015, 7:52 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Myles just summed it up perfectly
15/01/2015, 12:38 p.m. - James Edgson: So assuming no tropical vacations get in the way who's going to see the Arkells at crocks? Jen and I are going
15/01/2015, 12:39 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Of course. And Hey Rosetta at crocks!
15/01/2015, 12:41 p.m. - James Edgson: I knew you'd be in. Myles too?
15/01/2015, 12:41 p.m. - Mike Gleeson: When's hey Rosetta?
15/01/2015, 12:42 p.m. - James Edgson: I work during hey Rosetta :(
15/01/2015, 12:42 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Feb 20 I think
15/01/2015, 12:43 p.m. - Mike Gleeson: Gah in out of town
15/01/2015, 12:45 p.m. - Kirsten Novak: I'm going to both!
15/01/2015, 1:21 p.m. - James Edgson: Well Arkells should be a big blasty blast. While I'm out today I might try to buy tickets
15/01/2015, 1:39 p.m. - Ryan Novak: <Media omitted>
15/01/2015, 2:38 p.m. - Nick Berardi: I'm in for hey Rosetta
15/01/2015, 5:59 p.m. - Myles Vescio: I'm in for both !
15/01/2015, 6:06 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Think we need tickets in advance or should be okay at the door for these shin digs
15/01/2015, 6:07 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Get me tickets james
15/01/2015, 6:07 p.m. - James Edgson: Im gonna get tickets in advance.

25/01/2015, 3:30 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Holy hell $1480
25/01/2015, 3:30 p.m. - Alyson: It's Costa Rica !! Lol
25/01/2015, 3:30 p.m. - Brie Gibson: I thought the problem was budget in the beginning
25/01/2015, 3:31 p.m. - Alyson: Well kir and spen decided not to come and Myles can use his points for this trip so it works out pretty good
25/01/2015, 3:32 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Oh I see
25/01/2015, 3:32 p.m. - Alyson: Did you guys book Cuba already ? If you change your mind come to Costa Rica !
25/01/2015, 3:33 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Naw we booked and thats over what I wanted to spend also
25/01/2015, 3:33 p.m. - Alyson: But there's volcanoes and jungle !! lol
25/01/2015, 3:34 p.m. - Gary Graham: I would consider coming if Olivia could also come, but she's occupied and I don't wanna be a 7th or 9th wheel Haha.
25/01/2015, 3:34 p.m. - Alyson: Gary it's like 1150-1200 ish from Toronto I looked for you
25/01/2015, 3:35 p.m. - Brie Gibson: volcanoe does not exactly sound appealing to me...
25/01/2015, 3:35 p.m. - Gary Graham: Oh thanks pal! That's not too expensive,
25/01/2015, 3:35 p.m. - Alyson: Well think about it everyone were gonna wait til tues to book so we can make sure we can get time off work
25/01/2015, 3:36 p.m. - Alyson: Nick you can do it online from work probably cause I don't think we will be ready to book tomorrow
25/01/2015, 3:38 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Gary you won't be if I go
25/01/2015, 3:39 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Cause Jodi is working so
25/01/2015, 3:39 p.m. - Gary Graham: Hmm interesting...
25/01/2015, 3:39 p.m. - Nick Berardi: I would want to book with my aeroplan miles
25/01/2015, 3:39 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Well its a shame we all couldn't get on the same page this time around. Maybe next time I suppose
25/01/2015, 3:40 p.m. - Nick Berardi: I'm not 100 in yet though cause. I fishing school 2 days before and have to check me. Home. First so
25/01/2015, 3:40 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Yah ..
25/01/2015, 3:43 p.m. - Alyson: We were all kind of more interested in Costa Rica cause it's got lots to do ... I know you guys kind of wanted a beach vacay but if you change your mind I'm sure they could change it for you .. Westjet goes to this resort too
25/01/2015, 3:44 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Nah thats cool, just didn't know Ryan and Rachel weren't the only ones considering at the time they told me. Just unfortunate since we didn't know most people were considering Costa Rica to begin with
25/01/2015, 3:45 p.m. - Michael Conrad: What's done is done though. At least I get to drank on the beach
25/01/2015, 3:45 p.m. - Brie Gibson: just a shame we tried so hard to accommodate everyone else, I ended up picking a later date then i originally wanted. And even a slightly cheaper hotel, and now budget is blown out of the water and everyone is cool with that now.
25/01/2015, 3:47 p.m. - James Edgson: Can't please everybody, never gonna work without lots of compromises
25/01/2015, 3:48 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Just bitter is all. But me and mike will have fun either way! 🙌
25/01/2015, 3:48 p.m. - Alyson: Well I don't know about everyone else but part of my decision is that I don't mind spending a bit more to go to Costa Rica cause it's different and I haven't been there yet
25/01/2015, 3:50 p.m. - Michael Conrad: That's fair just wish we had felt more like part of that discussion. Ryan had mentioned it to me but I guess I wasn't aware that multiple people were discussing it as an option at the time since nothing was really posted
25/01/2015, 3:50 p.m. - Gary Graham: Yeah I think I'll pass on both.
25/01/2015, 3:51 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Either way can't please everyone. No point in us crying over spilt milk I suppose
25/01/2015, 3:52 p.m. - Alyson: It was just getting so hard to please everyone cause everyone had specific things they want so I thought that was why we decided to just look separately
25/01/2015, 3:52 p.m. - James Edgson: You can cry over your Cuban cervezas several weeks before anyone else
25/01/2015, 3:53 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Ill try to avoid doing that if possible. Maybe I can make some quirky cubanos friends
25/01/2015, 3:53 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lol a couple darker stand ins for the week
25/01/2015, 3:53 p.m. - Brie Gibson: We'll make some new friends!
25/01/2015, 3:55 p.m. - Alyson: Ok so nobody's hates anyone ? Everybody's still friends lol?
25/01/2015, 3:57 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Of course not. I mean of course were a little bitter not so much with the result as the process but like I said what's done is done, not much to do about it now anyways
25/01/2015, 3:58 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lol but I think I'll be able to manage having a good time at a resort. The beach will cure all
25/01/2015, 3:59 p.m. - James Edgson: I went to mexico with 7 strangers and Andrew bond. It was a blast. You can manage
25/01/2015, 4:01 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Time to find me some strangers
25/01/2015, 4:01 p.m. - Brie Gibson: We did fine last time!!

30/03/2015, 7:15 p.m. - Nick Berardi: You have no events
30/03/2015, 7:15 p.m. - Nick Berardi: This city needs way more attention to other issues rather then wasting the money on a building. That wonf be used
30/03/2015, 7:16 p.m. - Myles Vescio: Yeah. At least it was a way to clean up the downtown mess area without relying on private parties to open up new bars/etc
30/03/2015, 7:16 p.m. - Gary Graham: I propose we replace every building downtown with a bar
30/03/2015, 7:17 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Let's just demo. It all. And start a scrap metal and demo Company

30/03/2015, 7:21 p.m. - Nick Berardi: Lol
30/03/2015, 7:22 p.m. - Myles Vescio: Why hasn't Steve opened up a cash money yet. He's got the credentials. Clearly business is booming

25/05/2015, 12:57 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: You could probably make one up related to tbay
25/05/2015, 12:59 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Dirty deeds and the bogan chief?

25/05/2015, 1:16 p.m. - Ryan Novak: New strategy. Completely random sentences that are funny and absurd. Think old guy mishearing his wife
25/05/2015, 1:16 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: I've got 99 donuts but mitch ate one
25/05/2015, 1:17 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Sweet dreams are made of cheese
25/05/2015, 1:22 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Bake it through to the other side

25/05/2015, 1:23 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lol can't tell if this would have happened anyway or if it was subtly guided by the earlier suggestions

25/05/2015, 4:42 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I think it's hard because the more absurd you make it (to make it funnier) the less you initially get what the ad is for
25/05/2015, 4:43 p.m. - Myles Vescio: I think they would work if you just added in a descriptive tag line
25/05/2015, 4:44 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Yeah it'll need massaging if it has any hopes of seeing the light of day. The problem with a descriptive tag on a billboard is that no ones reading it all

25/05/2015, 4:44 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Yeah its hard to get everything across at first glance

25/05/2015, 4:47 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I feel like these ones make you want to read the additional info more since they confuse you at first
25/05/2015, 4:47 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Thanks for joining in the creative exercise today gang. Felt like it was take your friends to work day.

21/09/2015, 8:57 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Pax 2? I'm guessing it's a vape based on James comment?
21/09/2015, 8:58 p.m. - James Edgson: Such vape
21/09/2015, 8:58 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Google it. It was engaget. Imagine if apple made a vaporizor

21/09/2015, 9:26 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Looks pretty solid for a portable but I dunno, if I was gonna spend that much I'd probably just get a volcano or something:P
21/09/2015, 9:26 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Especially since u picked up this guy http://torontovaporizer.ca/zeus-smite-vaporizer.html
21/09/2015, 9:27 p.m. - Michael Conrad: And it actually works very well for a portable but I picked it up on salez for about 99
21/09/2015, 9:28 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Not as sleek as that Pax but quality is good and it gets a nice vapour and you can't beat that price tag
21/09/2015, 9:28 p.m. - Steven Edgson: The whole "if apple made a vaporizer" just means it's over priced and stole all the ideas from someone else and said they created it
21/09/2015, 9:29 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lmao
21/09/2015, 9:30 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Bet it breaks from a foot up then too

11/10/2015, 11:02 a.m. - Myles Vescio: All I can see is what appears to be a Nokia brick phone on the table. This photo already looks like it's old. Imagine what our kids will think
11/10/2015, 11:03 a.m. - Myles Vescio: "Dad what are you doing here?" "We used to have spaghetti parties kids"
11/10/2015, 11:04 a.m. - James Edgson: Time we tough during the war, spaghetti was all we had
11/10/2015, 11:05 a.m. - Myles Vescio: Bag of noodles and canned sauce. This was one of those occasions we could afford a little herbs and spices
11/10/2015, 11:05 a.m. - Myles Vescio: We were all laughing because we were just so happy to have full bellies

12/10/2015, 2:01 a.m. - Steven Edgson: We created it for tinder, we're choosing the girls, I have almost zero say on the girls
12/10/2015, 2:01 a.m. - Brie Gibson: Lol what
12/10/2015, 2:04 a.m. - Steven Edgson: We originally browsed tinder with Kelsey's profile but that got boring, so we created one for me, but that required making a Facebook profile first
12/10/2015, 2:09 a.m. - Brie Gibson: Woo
12/10/2015, 6:38 a.m. - Melissa Randle: Did you delete it already? Wtf give it a chance
13/10/2015, 1:46 p.m. - James Edgson: Jennifer and I are having a Tofurkey dinner tonight. Everyone welcome to come to our misfit thanksgiving

13/10/2015, 3:27 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Aww lol, hey James where is a good place to get a safety on a car? I need to safety mine before "selling it" to Mike
13/10/2015, 3:27 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Me &Mike would come but I work at 5 and he's not off until after 5 :(
13/10/2015, 3:29 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Why are you selling it to Mike
13/10/2015, 3:29 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Can't he just insure himself on it and you remain with the title
13/10/2015, 3:29 p.m. - Brie Gibson: It's my moms car, and I have to sell it to him for $1
13/10/2015, 3:29 p.m. - James Edgson: Tell him to come over anyways
13/10/2015, 3:29 p.m. - James Edgson: Yeah
13/10/2015, 3:30 p.m. - Brie Gibson: She has to sell it to him actually
13/10/2015, 3:30 p.m. - James Edgson: Take it to east end service, he took the crown Vic there
13/10/2015, 3:30 p.m. - Brie Gibson: Kk I just hope there's nothing majorly wrong..I don't think there is. Apparently u can only swap cars if your married and your swapping to your spouse.
13/10/2015, 3:33 p.m. - Ryan Novak: Rach and I don't get off until 5 and even then it's usually a bit after. Plus a shower and stuff so we'll be a bit later. Can probably swing 6 but don't sweat it if that's too late
13/10/2015, 3:34 p.m. - Brie Gibson: K I'll let Mike know about tonight, I will not be in attendance :(
13/10/2015, 3:44 p.m. - James Edgson: Okay Ryan that's cool
13/10/2015, 5:47 p.m. - Ryan Novak: <Media omitted>

13/10/2015, 5:51 p.m. - Michael Conrad: You know someone's messed that one up on their grocery run
13/10/2015, 5:52 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I assume you were there for the Prep H then?
13/10/2015, 5:53 p.m. - Steven Edgson: That would be a regrettable mistake
13/10/2015, 5:53 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Haha one way or the other
13/10/2015, 5:54 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lol I guess a nice spearmint could be soothing regardless...
13/10/2015, 5:57 p.m. - James Edgson: Dinner is ready and the pies are on table
13/10/2015, 5:59 p.m. - Ryan Novak: There in 10-15

13/10/2015, 6:12 p.m. - James Edgson: Tofurkey
13/10/2015, 6:16 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I'm torn between trying this bird and lying on the couch rn. Just zonked
13/10/2015, 6:47 p.m. - James Edgson: We do have pumpkin pie
14/10/2015, 11:53 a.m. - Brie Gibson: Mike was I sured at Allstate with his 88 crown Vic..and his renewal rate was $172/mo. I told them to put him in with the 97 Honda and his rate went all the way up to $205? Does that make sense when its a newer car with better safety standards?
14/10/2015, 11:54 a.m. - Mike Gleeson: That seems strange, but I know nothing of insurance.
14/10/2015, 11:54 a.m. - Brie Gibson: Then I called another company they quoted him $105...$100 less than Allstate who he's with for a year
14/10/2015, 11:54 a.m. - Spencer Ranta: Do you have an accident on your record
14/10/2015, 11:55 a.m. - Brie Gibson: He has 1 at fault and I told them
14/10/2015, 11:55 a.m. - Spencer Ranta: Then it makes sense
14/10/2015, 11:55 a.m. - Spencer Ranta: But it's a no brainer, get the cheaper one !
14/10/2015, 11:56 a.m. - Brie Gibson: Yah but my insurance is way higher on that one, lower with Allstate. and we're getting discounts for same household cars ...this is dumb
14/10/2015, 11:57 a.m. - Spencer Ranta: Ya definitely dumb.. Either way just shop around and take whoever is cheaper. For me, belair was cheaper
14/10/2015, 11:57 a.m. - Brie Gibson: I may have to try them next.
14/10/2015, 12:21 p.m. - Myles Vescio: Insurance companies only make money because people don't shop around. I had Belair too until we bought a house now we have allstate for everything
14/10/2015, 1:17 p.m. - ‪+1 (807) 621-5549‬: Brie try gillons that's where I went and got a good deal cause Allstate screwed me when I got my new car
14/10/2015, 3:17 p.m. - Melissa Randle: Insurance companies LOVE it when you leave if you've never made a claim because they just banked all the loney youve given them and never have to worry about paying you out again lol. So dont feel bad, have your cars insured all over the place, whatever is the better deal for you!
14/10/2015, 3:18 p.m. - Melissa Randle: Also gang; look what i got in th mail today for our next games night...
14/10/2015, 3:18 p.m. - Melissa Randle: <Media omitted>
14/10/2015, 3:19 p.m. - James Edgson: Looks fun
14/10/2015, 3:21 p.m. - Melissa Randle: Its perfect for us cause its like, heres a fucked up card, everyone go around the circle and explain why you think someone fits it... So basically you just sit around and insult everyone lol
14/10/2015, 4:00 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I like it!
14/10/2015, 4:00 p.m. - Michael Conrad: And yeah buying insurance is the pits. I'm using kanetix rn to get some rates but its looking like 200 is still the best price I'm gonna get😞
14/10/2015, 4:10 p.m. - Michael Conrad: They aren't kidding when they say one fault messes up your rates. I literally tapped this person and I'm getting gouged
14/10/2015, 4:12 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: "Best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour".. An insurance company probably came up with that quote
14/10/2015, 4:14 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: You're getting the Joan Collins special though.. Those prices are nuts
14/10/2015, 4:18 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Holy fuck nvm I just struck oil though! You can keep your Joan Collins joke to yourself
14/10/2015, 4:18 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Just found 104 dollars a month
14/10/2015, 4:18 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I'd say that's a little easier to swallow
14/10/2015, 4:21 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: Sweet deal, that's reasonable for someone who has no accidents
14/10/2015, 4:23 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Why ya gotta break balls Spenny?
14/10/2015, 4:25 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: I'm on your side , I can't stand shopping for insurance
14/10/2015, 4:29 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I know! I've never had to search so hard for something I don't even want
14/10/2015, 4:29 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: I also have an accident on my record , mine doesn't even have another vehicle involved and they fuck me for it
14/10/2015, 4:29 p.m. - Michael Conrad: I feel your pain brother
14/10/2015, 4:29 p.m. - Michael Conrad: What'd ya hit?
14/10/2015, 4:30 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Or is that the time you turned it in the ditch?
14/10/2015, 4:30 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: Yeah, the ditch. Was quite a wreck though
14/10/2015, 4:31 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Yeah that's total bullshit, clearly at some point Jesus took the wheel on that one
14/10/2015, 4:31 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: Lesson learned don't call 911 in that scenario .. If you're okay that is
14/10/2015, 4:32 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lol funny how they offer these services and then punish you for using them
14/10/2015, 4:33 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Moreso in your case clearly. All I had to do was put down a chicken wrap and I'd have spared myself so much trouble
14/10/2015, 4:33 p.m. - James Edgson: In British Columbia insurance is a government thing. So at least prices are straight across the board
14/10/2015, 4:33 p.m. - James Edgson: Or so I hear
14/10/2015, 4:34 p.m. - Michael Conrad: BC's just looking better and better these days:P
14/10/2015, 4:34 p.m. - Steven Edgson: Except the cost of living part
14/10/2015, 4:34 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Yeahhhh
14/10/2015, 4:34 p.m. - Michael Conrad: But if you ignore that
14/10/2015, 4:35 p.m. - James Edgson: It's cheapish living in the interior of BC, but then it's pretty much just Alberta
14/10/2015, 4:36 p.m. - Michael Conrad: But I don't wanna work on an oil rig
14/10/2015, 4:36 p.m. - James Edgson: Hey now, it's not all oil rigs
14/10/2015, 4:36 p.m. - James Edgson: You can also work on a fracting rig
14/10/2015, 4:37 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Lol
14/10/2015, 4:37 p.m. - Michael Conrad: You're right I retract my objection
14/10/2015, 4:37 p.m. - James Edgson: Did you get the accord into a shop for safety
14/10/2015, 4:38 p.m. - James Edgson: It must be hard finding someone to work on such advanced technology
14/10/2015, 4:40 p.m. - Michael Conrad: Yeah I have to wait, they're flying someone in from Geneva
14/10/2015, 4:41 p.m. - Michael Conrad: But yeah I phoned East End Service so they're gonna take it in Tuesday morning for me
14/10/2015, 4:42 p.m. - Myles Vescio: Jim how does it feel driving a vehicle from the 21st century?

15/10/2015, 1:39 p.m. - Spencer Ranta: Well mainly I just mean contacts, that's usually the biggest pain when getting a new phone.. I always save my contacts to my Google account .. When you sign back in your phone will take in the contacts from google
